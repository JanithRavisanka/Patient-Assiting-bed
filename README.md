# Patient Assisting Bed

An intelligent, auto-adjustable bed system designed to enhance patient comfort by monitoring vital parameters such as body temperature, heart rate, and humidity. The system includes automated bed adjustments, an alerting mechanism, and voice command support for hands-free control, integrated with Firebase for real-time data management and built using Arduino.

## Key Features

- **Vital Monitoring**: Continuously monitors body temperature, heart rate, and humidity levels to ensure optimal comfort.
- **Auto-Adjustable Bed**: Automatically adjusts the bed based on patient needs and environmental conditions.
- **Alerting System**: Provides alerts for abnormal readings or when manual intervention is required.
- **Voice Command**: Allows patients or caregivers to control bed adjustments via voice commands.
- **Real-Time Data Management**: Uses Firebase for real-time storage and management of patient data.

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: Used for controlling sensors and automation.
- **Firebase**: Handles real-time data storage and retrieval.
- **Sensors**: Monitors body temperature, heart rate, and humidity.
- **Voice Recognition**: Provides voice control functionality for bed adjustments.
